# Terraform State Backend Setup

## This guide provides instructions for setting up an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table to serve as a backend for storing Terraform state files. Using this configuration helps you manage your Terraform state in a more reliable and collaborative manner.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables.

2. AWS CLI configured with the appropriate access keys and region.
Instructions

# Follow these steps to set up an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for Terraform state:

Step 1: Clone Your Terraform Configuration Repository

Clone your Terraform configuration repository to your local machine.

Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket

Create an S3 bucket for storing your Terraform state files using the AWS CLI.

Step 3: Configure Versioning for the S3 Bucket (Optional but Recommended)

Enable versioning for the S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

Step 4: Create a DynamoDB Table

Create a DynamoDB table to lock the state file during Terraform operations using the AWS CLI.

Step 5: Configure Terraform Backend

Edit your Terraform configuration (e.g., backend.tf or main.tf) to use the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table as the backend.

Step 6: Initialize and Apply

Initialize and apply your Terraform configuration as usual. Terraform will use the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state management.
